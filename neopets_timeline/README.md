# Neopets Timeline Page

This project is a mimic of the Neopets website, focusing specifically on a page where users can navigate through a book and explore the timeline of Neopets. The goal is to create an interactive and visually appealing way to learn about the history of Neopets, using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
## Features

- Interactive Book Navigation: Users can click through the pages of a book to explore different milestones in Neopets history.
- Dynamic Page Content: The content of the book changes dynamically as users navigate, with images and text that correspond to specific years in Neopets' history.
- Animated Cloud Background: A smoothly looping cloud animation that enhances the visual appeal of the page.
- Responsive Design: The page layout adjusts for different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Login/Sign Up Button: A visually striking button for logging in or signing up, styled with a gradient background and hover effects.
