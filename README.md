# Neopets Timeline Application

This project is a recreation of a Neopets-themed webpage, where users can interactively explore the timeline of Neopets through a book-like interface. The goal is to provide a visually appealing way to learn about the history of Neopets using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Users can run the project via **Visual Studio Code** or directly in the terminal.

## Features

- **Interactive Book Navigation**: Users can click through the pages of a book to explore different milestones in Neopets history.
- **Dynamic Page Content**: The content of the book changes dynamically as users navigate, with images and text that correspond to specific years in Neopets' history.
- **Animated Cloud Background**: A smoothly looping cloud animation enhances the visual appeal of the page.
- **Responsive Design**: The page layout adjusts for different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Login/Sign Up Button**: A visually striking button for logging in or signing up, styled with a gradient background and hover effects.

# How to Run the Application:
